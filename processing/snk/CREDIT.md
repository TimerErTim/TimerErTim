This code is based on the Snake contribution graph generator by Platane.

Original repository: https://github.com/Platane/snk/tree/main

The Snake contribution graph generator creates animated visualizations of GitHub contribution graphs in the form of a snake game, where the snake moves through and "eats" the contribution squares.
